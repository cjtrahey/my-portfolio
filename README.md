## General info
This project was designed to introduce us to an in-depth look at both HTML and CSS through creating a website from scratch. In addition to further developing our ability with the two front-end applications, the activity also introduced us to our first look at what a portfolio should look like, and how having a well-polished one could greatly benefit your career-finding opportunities. 

## Technologies
Project is created with: <br>
* CSS
* HTML
	
## Resources

## Troubleshooting
The following issues arose during the activity, some of which weren't able to be solved in this website mockup. <br>
* A hover-over fadeIn effect was originally intended for multiple photos, however during testing the result would be all images fading in at the same time, defeating the purpose of the idea.
* Some flex-box issues appeared, which can be solved in the future with repitition.
* Images in .md files appear to not work whenever adding one was attempted.
